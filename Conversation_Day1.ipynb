      "| **3. Snack as the Object‑of‑Desire (the *Form* of the Good*)** | The kernel of corn is the *idea* of nourishment, the perfect Form that all chickens intuitively seek. | Upon reaching the other side, the chicken’s beak meets the corn, and the world momentarily glows with buttery light. |\n",

The Peck‑and‑Pause as Meditative Praxis** | Each pause after a step is a moment of *mindful awareness*, a chance to contemplate the impermanence of traffic and the permanence of hunger. | The chicken tilts its head, watches a passing car, and whispers internally, “All things move, but my appetite remains.” |\n",

The Return to the Coop as the Cycle of Return** | After the snack, the bird returns home, bringing back *wisdom* (the kernel) and *experience* (the crossing) for the flock. | The coop becomes a classroom where the story of the crossing is retold, inspiring younger chicks to venture forth. |\n",
